# Lab2Go - A Project sized for Schools

This is a project done in school, in a course called "Lab2Go".
This course was intended to be an approach to the usage of coding and Arduino, with physics.

It use a light on the ball of the Pendulum, so the change of brightness can be registrated by the photoresistance, connected to the Breadboard that is connected to an Arduino.
The Arduino, having the code, plot out the variation of brightness, done by the light on the ball of the pendulum, on the "Serial Plotter" (it can be found in the Arduino IDE).
The variation of the plot is the *Passage of the Pendulum*, the main goal of this Project.

The project is structured in this way:

1. The Physics Part (also called "The Boring Part"), where you learn the physics behind the Pendulum.
2. The Construction Part without Elettronics, where you build the Pendulum.
3. The Arduino-boring-explanation Part, where you explain what Arduino does and how it works.
4. The also-coding-boring-explanation Part, where you explain what is the code and coding, explaining also the Arduino Programming Language.
5. The "Arduino & Breadboard" Part (also called "The fun Part"), where you build all the necessary parts on the Breadboard.
6. The Connection Part, where you connect everything to the Pendulum and to the computer.
7. The Test Part, where you hope the best
8. The Final Part, where you're happy because the project is finished.
